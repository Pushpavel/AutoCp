## Quick start

#### Install plugin

See instructions [here](/docs/installation.md)

#### Generate solution files

With the IDE project already open, Open the problem/ contest page in the browser and press the competitive companion
button in the browser. This will generate files with default file template. You can change the programming language
in <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Tools</kbd> > <kbd>AutoCp</kbd> before generating the files.

#### Edit testcases

<kbd>View</kbd> > <kbd>Tool Windows</kbd> > <kbd>AutoCp</kbd> opens a tool window containing the testcases of the
currently selected file.

#### Check the solution

Right-click the solution file and run using AutoCp.

## File Structure

!> Information here is outdated, will be updated soon

files are generated inside a folder named like ```<judge> - <category/contest>``` that the problem belongs to.

!> Moving or renaming files will unlink the solution file to its problem. This restriction will be removed

#### ```.autocp``` file at the root of the project

This file stores the problems and testcases. It is very crucial to this plugin and should not be touched.
