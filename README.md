### Screenshot

### ```.autocp``` file

This file stores the problems and testcases you gathered using <kbd>Gather Problems</kbd> Action. It is very crucial to
this plugin and should not be touched.

### File Structure

<kbd>Gather Problems</kbd> Action generates solution files inside a folder named by
the ```<judge> - <category/contest>``` that the problem belongs to.

> Moving or renaming files will unlink the solution file to its problem
> This restriction will be removed

### Limitations

Hopefully, these limitations will be removed soon.

- Memory Limit is ignored.
- Strict File Structure
- No Debugging through AutoCp
- Only files created by AutoCp can be run by AutoCp
