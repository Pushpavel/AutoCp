# Contributing to ```AutoCp```

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Your help is essential for keeping this project great. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## How can I help?

- Writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation.
- Pull requests are Great and are actively welcomed ðŸ˜ƒ, it could be simple grammar fixes to adding new features

## Pull Request Guidelines

> Branch Off from ```dev``` branch to develop features and bug fixes, see [Branches](#Branches).

If you have never created a pull request before, welcome
ðŸ˜º. [Here is a quick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4) for you.

- __Please ask first__ before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code)
- __Keep your change as focused as possible__. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not
  dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- __Write a decent commit message__, please avoid messages like ```update code```ðŸ˜….

## Branches

We can follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) with few modifications

- The principles of GitHub Flow apply to the ```dev``` branch instead of the ```main``` branch, and merging ```dev```
  to ```main``` marks a release
- This gives us the ability to make __hot fixes__ and __reliable__ releases
