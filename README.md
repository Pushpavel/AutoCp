### Why is there a ```.autocp``` file at the root of my project ?

This file stores the problems and testcases you gathered using <kbd>Gather Problems</kbd> Action. It is very crucial to
this plugin and should not be touched.

### File Structure

<kbd>Gather Problems</kbd> Action generates solution files inside a folder named by
the [group](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion#explanation) that the problem belows to.
> Moving or renaming files will unlink the solution file to its problem

### Limitations

- Time Limit and Memory Limit is ignored.
- Strict File Structure
