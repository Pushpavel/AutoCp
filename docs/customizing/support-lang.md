#### File Template

The selected file template is used to generate files of this
language. [File Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/settings-file-and-code-templates.html) support is built
into the IDE. For customizing or creating new file templates [refer this](/docs/customizing/file-template.md).

#### Default Build Configuration

This build configuration is set by default while creating a AutoCp run configuration for a solution file. More
on [build configuration](/docs/customizing/support-build-config.md).
