## Creating Files

- Go to the contest or problem page in your browser.
- With your IDE project open, activate Competitive Companion browser extension.

- It takes about 2-3 seconds for the __Generate Files__ dialog to show. Files are created in the background, so you can
  start coding as soon as you click OK.
