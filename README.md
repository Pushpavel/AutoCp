### ```.autocp``` file

This file stores the problems and testcases you gathered using <kbd>Gather Problems</kbd> Action. It is very crucial to
this plugin and should not be touched.

### File Structure

<kbd>Gather Problems</kbd> Action generates solution files inside a folder named by
the [group](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion#explanation) (mostly Contest Name) that the problem belongs
to.

> Moving or renaming files will unlink the solution file to its problem
> This restriction will be removed

### Limitations
Hopefully, these limitations will be removed soon.

- Memory Limit is ignored.
- Strict File Structure
- No Debugging through AutoCp
- Only files created by AutoCp can be run by AutoCp
